                    <h3>Traffic Survey Data Analyzer Project</h3>
                    <p class="post-date">Posted on <time datetime="2024-10-15">October 15, 2025</time></p>

                    <p>I recently worked on a Python project that analyzes traffic survey data from CSV files. In this
                        post, I will share what the project does and what I learned.</p>

                    <h4>What Does It Do?</h4>
                    <p>The Traffic Survey Data Analyzer is a console-based tool that processes traffic data from urban
                        junctions. It analyzes vehicle counts, truck percentages, electric vehicles, and rainfall data.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Key Features</h4>
                    <p>Some important features include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Date Validation</strong> - Users enter a date and the program validates it</li>
                        <li><strong>Data Analysis</strong> - Calculates total vehicles, trucks, and EVs</li>
                        <li><strong>Visualizations</strong> - Creates histograms showing hourly traffic patterns</li>
                        <li><strong>Multiple Junctions</strong> - Tracks data from different road intersections</li>
                        <li><strong>Rainfall Tracking</strong> - Records weather conditions during surveys</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>How It Works</h4>
                    <p>The program asks for a survey date, finds the matching CSV file, and then analyzes the data. It
                        shows statistics like total vehicles and creates color-coded graphs for each junction.</p>

                    <h4>What I Learned</h4>
                    <p>This project taught me how to work with CSV files, validate user input, and create data
                        visualizations using Python libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib.</p>

                    <p>Building this tool helped me understand how data analysis can solve real-world problems like
                        traffic planning and congestion management.</p>

                    <h3>My First Year Web Development Group Project</h3>
                    <p class="post-date">Posted on <time datetime="2024-10-15">October 15, 2025</time></p>

                    <p>During my first year, I worked on an exciting group project where we built a complete web
                        application. I want to share my experience and what I contributed to the project.</p>

                    <h4>Responsive Sitemap with SVG</h4>
                    <p>I created a responsive sitemap using SVG graphics. This visual representation showed the
                        structure of our website and how different pages connected to each other. The sitemap adjusted
                        beautifully to different screen sizes, making it easy to view on both desktop and mobile
                        devices.</p>

                    <h4>Page Editor</h4>
                    <p>One of my main contributions was building a page editor. This feature allowed users to create and
                        modify content on the website. I learned a lot about handling user input and updating content
                        dynamically using JavaScript.</p>

                    <h4>Validation Page</h4>
                    <p>I developed a validation page that checked user inputs to make sure all information was correct
                        before submitting. This included:</p><br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Required information checks</li>
                        <li>Error handling</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Profile Page</h4>
                    <p>I also built a user profile page where people could view and edit their personal information. The
                        profile page was responsive and included features like profile picture display, editable fields,
                        and a clean user interface.</p>

                    <h4>What I Learned</h4>
                    <p>This group project taught me valuable skills in teamwork, responsive design, and building
                        functional web applications. Working with my team helped me understand how different parts of a
                        website work together.</p>

                    <p>I am proud of what we accomplished and excited to build more complex projects in the future!</p>
